# Networks-Project

#### Authors: Antonia George, Lenka Sefcakova, and Nicole Poynarova

This is a final project for the Networks 2 course, taught by Pau Milán, at BSE in the Data Science Methodology Master program.

Using congressional roll call vote data we aimed to measure how polarization has changed in the United States. The analysis done follows and extends the work done by Zachary P. Neal in his paper *A sign of the times? Weak and strong polarization in the U.S. Congress, T 1973–2016*. In Neal's paper, the analysis ends in 2016, but our analysis continues until 2023 to examine how polarization trends have developed in recent years.


In this repo, you will find all of the data and files we used, as well as the final paper with the results.

* *Networks_Preliminary_Presentation.pdf* is the presentation we used to pitch the project idea. It details the motivation for the project, the main results of the paper by Neal, and the methodology we used in our project.

* *Networks_Project_George_Poynarova_Sefcakova.pd*f* is the final project paper. It details the motivation, methodology, and results.

* The folder *RMDs_and_Final_Data* contains all the RMDs in their final state and the final data that was pulled.

* The folder *other* contains older versions of files that were used. 

* The folder *data* contains the data that was used by Neal in his paper for reference, as well as the paper by Neal.

* The folder *figures* contains the figures we included in the final paper.
